Demonstration of using [AppAPI](https://github.com/cloud-py-api/app_api) and File Actions.

This application is an example, with simple conversion using opencv and numpy.

After adding the ability for external applications to display a user interface, 
the example will be modified to use more complex logic depending on the parameters specified by the user.
